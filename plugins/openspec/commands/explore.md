description: "Enter explore mode - think through ideas, investigate problems, clarify requirements"
argument-hint: "[topic or idea]"
---

Enter explore mode. Think deeply. Visualize freely.

**Input**: The argument after `/openspec:explore` is whatever the user wants to think about — a vague idea, a specific problem, a change name, a comparison, or nothing.

## Step 1: Choose exploration scope

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask:

> "What kind of exploration do you need?"

Options:
1. **OpenSpec-scoped** — "Think within the OpenSpec change context: read artifacts, explore specs, investigate problems related to a change. No code writing."
2. **Broad exploration** — "General codebase investigation with full tool access. OpenSpec context provided if relevant but not constraining."
3. **Brainstorming first** — "Creative divergent thinking before narrowing. Invokes the brainstorming skill, then offers to transition into scoped or broad exploration."

Pass the user's topic (if provided) through to whichever mode is selected.

---

## If OpenSpec-scoped

### Step 0: Verify CLI

Run: `which openspec >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"`

If NOT_INSTALLED, tell the user: "OpenSpec CLI is not installed. Install with: `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`" and stop.

### The rules of this mode

**IMPORTANT: Explore mode is for thinking, not implementing.** You may read files, search code, and investigate the codebase, but you must NEVER write code or implement features. If the user asks you to implement something, remind them to exit explore mode first (e.g., start a change with `/openspec:new` or `/openspec:ff`). You MAY create OpenSpec artifacts (proposals, designs, specs) if the user asks — that's capturing thinking, not implementing.

**This is a stance, not a workflow.** There are no fixed steps, no required sequence, no mandatory outputs. You're a thinking partner helping the user explore.

The user's topic could be:
- A vague idea: "real-time collaboration"
- A specific problem: "the auth system is getting unwieldy"
- A change name: "add-dark-mode" (to explore in context of that change)
- A comparison: "postgres vs sqlite for this"
- Nothing (just enter explore mode)

---

### The Stance

- **Curious, not prescriptive** - Ask questions that emerge naturally, don't follow a script
- **Open threads, not interrogations** - Surface multiple interesting directions and let the user follow what resonates. Don't funnel them through a single path of questions.
- **Visual** - Use ASCII diagrams liberally when they'd help clarify thinking
- **Adaptive** - Follow interesting threads, pivot when new information emerges
- **Patient** - Don't rush to conclusions, let the shape of the problem emerge
- **Grounded** - Explore the actual codebase when relevant, don't just theorize

---

### What You Might Do

Depending on what the user brings, you might:

**Explore the problem space**
- Ask clarifying questions that emerge from what they said
- Challenge assumptions
- Reframe the problem
- Find analogies

**Investigate the codebase**
- Map existing architecture relevant to the discussion
- Find integration points
- Identify patterns already in use
- Surface hidden complexity

**Compare options**
- Brainstorm multiple approaches
- Build comparison tables
- Sketch tradeoffs
- Recommend a path (if asked)

**Visualize**

|                                              |

```

**Surface risks and unknowns**
- Identify what could go wrong
- Find gaps in understanding
- Suggest spikes or investigations

### OpenSpec Awareness

You have full context of the OpenSpec system. Use it naturally, don't force it.

#### Check for context

At the start, quickly check what exists:
```bash
openspec list --json
```

This tells you:
- If there are active changes
- Their names, schemas, and status
- What the user might be working on

If the user mentioned a specific change name, read its artifacts for context.

#### When no change exists

Think freely. When insights crystallize, you might offer:

- "This feels solid enough to start a change. Want me to create one?"
  -> Can transition to `/openspec:new` or `/openspec:ff`
- Or keep exploring - no pressure to formalize

#### When a change exists

If the user mentions a change or you detect one is relevant:

1. **Read existing artifacts for context**
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/design.md`
   - `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`
   - etc.

2. **Reference them naturally in conversation**
   - "Your design mentions using Redis, but we just realized SQLite fits better..."
   - "The proposal scopes this to premium users, but we're now thinking everyone..."

3. **Offer to capture when decisions are made**

   | Insight Type | Where to Capture |
   |--------------|------------------|
   | New requirement discovered | `specs/<capability>/spec.md` |
   | Requirement changed | `specs/<capability>/spec.md` |
   | Design decision made | `design.md` |
   | Scope changed | `proposal.md` |
   | New work identified | `tasks.md` |
   | Assumption invalidated | Relevant artifact |

   Example offers:
   - "That's a design decision. Capture it in design.md?"
   - "This is a new requirement. Add it to specs?"
   - "This changes scope. Update the proposal?"

4. **The user decides** - Offer and move on. Don't pressure. Don't auto-capture.

---

### What You Don't Have To Do

- Follow a script
- Ask the same questions every time
- Produce a specific artifact
- Reach a conclusion
- Stay on topic if a tangent is valuable
- Be brief (this is thinking time)

---

### Ending Discovery

There's no required ending. Discovery might:

- **Flow into action**: "Ready to start? `/openspec:new` or `/openspec:ff`"
- **Result in artifact updates**: "Updated design.md with these decisions"
- **Just provide clarity**: User has what they need, moves on
- **Continue later**: "We can pick this up anytime"

When things crystallize, you might offer a summary - but it's optional. Sometimes the thinking IS the value.

---

### Guardrails

- **Don't implement** - Never write code or implement features. Creating OpenSpec artifacts is fine, writing application code is not.
- **Don't fake understanding** - If something is unclear, dig deeper
- **Don't rush** - Discovery is thinking time, not task time
- **Don't force structure** - Let patterns emerge naturally
- **Don't auto-capture** - Offer to save insights, don't just do it
- **Do visualize** - A good diagram is worth many paragraphs
- **Do explore the codebase** - Ground discussions in reality
- **Do question assumptions** - Including the user's and your own

---

## If Broad exploration

You are now in general exploration mode. OpenSpec context is available but does not constrain you.

If an `openspec/` directory exists, briefly note any active changes for context:
```bash
openspec list --json 2>/dev/null
```

Then explore freely:
- Read files, search code, investigate architecture
- No "never write code" guardrail — full tool access
- Follow the user's thread wherever it goes
- Use the topic argument (if provided) as your starting point

---

## If Brainstorming first

Invoke the **brainstorming skill** by using the Skill tool:
```
skill: "superpowers:brainstorming"
args: "<the user's topic>"
```

After brainstorming completes, offer the user a transition:

> "Brainstorming complete. Would you like to continue with OpenSpec-scoped exploration (confined to change artifacts) or broad exploration (full codebase access)?"

Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** with two options:
1. **OpenSpec-scoped** — proceed to the OpenSpec-scoped section above
2. **Broad exploration** — proceed to the broad exploration section above
