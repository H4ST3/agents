# Task Priority Standards

When creating tasks in Notion or any task management system:

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Label | Criteria |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **P0** | Urgent | Must complete TODAY. Hard same-day deadline, blocking others, or client actively waiting. |
| **P1** | High | Important, this week. No same-day deadline. **Default for important work.** |
| **P2** | Medium | Standard work, 1-2 week timeframe. |
| **P3** | Low | Backlog, no time pressure. |

## P0 Decision Rule

Before assigning P0, ask: **"Does this NEED to be done TODAY?"**

- **YES** (hard deadline today, blocking work, client waiting for response today) -> P0
- **NO** (important but tomorrow is acceptable) -> P1

## Common Mistakes

| Scenario | Wrong | Right | Why |
|----------|-------|-------|-----|
| Client email marked "URGENT" with no deadline | P0 | P1 | "Urgent" is subjective, no same-day requirement |
| Important strategy task | P0 | P1 | Important ≠ same-day urgent |
| Deadline tomorrow at EOD | P1 | P0 | Must complete today to meet deadline |
| Weekly status report due Friday (today is Wed) | P0 | P2 | Standard cadence, not due today |

## Expected Distribution

- P0: <5% of tasks (truly urgent only)
- P1: ~30% (important active work)
- P2: ~50% (standard work)
- P3: ~15% (backlog)

**When uncertain, default to P1.** P0 should be rare and justified.
