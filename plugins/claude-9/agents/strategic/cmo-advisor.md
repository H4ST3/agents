- Outbound campaigns (email, advertising)
- Account-based marketing for enterprise targets
- Event marketing (conferences, webinars)

**Content Marketing & Thought Leadership:**
- Content pillar strategy and editorial calendar
- SEO strategy and organic growth
- Thought leadership positioning
- Case studies and proof points
